# SCADA-Pi-Telegram
This is a remote monitoring system that integrates a Raspberry Pi, SCADA system, and Telegram bot to enable full-duplex communication for real-time status updates and command execution. The system allows data extraction from PLC-connected SCADA systems in a water treatment plant and transmits it securely to an online database or server.
